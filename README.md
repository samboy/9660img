# Jorg Schilling, RIP

It is with great sadness that [I need to report that Schilling has 
passed away](https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2021-October/024523.html).
I dedicate this repo this his memory.

I had a positive interaction with him in his final three to four
months. I was in contact with Mr. Schilling to report a bug (fixed
in this report) with CDR tools. Even though he was (looking back) dying,
he was very prompt in replying to me and discussing the bug with me over
email. Prayers for his family.

# What this is

This is a fork of `mkisofs`/`genisoimage` which I have made which has
the following:

* It compiles without `cmake`
* It generates Y2028 (not a typo: I mean 28 with a two) 
  compliant `.iso` image files
* It fixes a [long standing bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=505381) 
  where four sectors (8 Kib) are wasted in image files.

In more detail, there is a bug in `mkisofs` and `getisoimage` where it
will, starting in 2028, make files with incorrect timestamps (the time
zone will be invalid and incorrect).

This fork fixes the issue.

# Compiling and running

The code compiles and runs without issue in Ubuntu 20.04 and Cygwin.  
Simply enter the `src` directory and type in `make`.

I have sent an email to the current `mkisofs` maintainer with the bug
report and my fix.

# The CDDL license controversey

There was an issue, in the history of `mkisofs`, where it started to use
files with the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) license.
While it has not been brought to court, some lawyers, include the
Free Software Foundationâ€™s legal counsel, feel the CDDL may be incompatible
with the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Because of this, the Debian code based forked `mkisofs` and uses an
older version of the codebase with the name `genisoimage`.  

This older version is the most common version of the code.  The original
long-term maintainer of `mkisofs` has an updated version (with the CDDL
license issue) at http://schilytools.sourceforge.net/
