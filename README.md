# What this is

This is a fork of `mkisofs`/`genisoimage` which I have made which has
the following:

* It compiles without `cmake`
* It generates Y2028 (not a typo: I mean 28 with a two) 
  compliant `.iso` image files

In more detail, there is a bug in `mkisofs` and `getisoimage` where it
will, starting in 2028, make files with incorrect timestamps (the time
zone will be invalid and incorrect).

This fork fixes the issue.

# Compiling and running

The code compiles and runs without issue in Ubuntu 20.04 and Cygwin.  
Simply enter the `src` directory and type in `make`.

# Bug report filed upstream

I have sent an email to the current `mkisofs` maintainer with the bug
report and my fix.

# The CDDL license controversey

There was an issue, in the history of `mkisofs`, where it started to use
files with the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) license.
While it has not been brought to court, some lawyers, include the
Free Software Foundationâ€™s legal counsel, feel the CDDL may be incompatible
with the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Because of this, the Debian code based forked `mkisofs` and uses an
older version of the codebase with the name `genisoimage`.  

This older version is the most common version of the code.  The original
long-term maintainer of `mkisofs` has an updated version (with the CDDL
license issue) at http://schilytools.sourceforge.net/
